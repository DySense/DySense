Run from source:

- Install Python 2.7
- Install setuptools https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions
- In a command shell run "setup.py install" (or "setup.py develop" if you'll be making changes)
- Look at the output.  If any dependency (e.g. pyzmq) failed to installed then you'll have to go out and install it yourself.  
- Download and install PyQt4.  This can't be installed automatically using the setup.py file.
